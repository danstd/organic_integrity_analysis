# organic_integrity_flask
The goal of this project is a dashboard website that shows analytics on USDA National Organic Program certification data.
XML data is requested from the USDA Organic Integrity Database API and loaded into a local database which is accessed using flask-sqlalchemy and analyzed using the Python Pandas package.
This project is now live at [organic-certification-analysis.com](https://organic-certification-analysis.com/).
